# SCP-773
Tolerance: 2

A bit of a different mission this time. This mission takes place in the wonderful [SCP Universe](http://www.scp-wiki.net), and has the players playing as Mobile Task Force Mu-3. Mobile Task Forces (MTFs) are highly trained groups of Foundation operatives specifically founded for specific tasks; in the case of MTF Mu-3, their task is to take anomalous objects from the control of *Marshall, Carter, and Dark*, a company who buys and sells in anomalous objects.

The SCP Universe is not actually designed to make missions for little-known RPGs, believe it or not. It's quite a lovely universe. I would recommend dipping your feet in it.

Here's a bunch of links if you want more context on this mission specifically:
